	<h1>Food delivery online at your address.</h1>
	The first online food order was a pizza from Pizza Hut in 1994.<br>


This is a picture from a 2018 Pizza Hut pizza box, which describes the first online food sale.
The online food ordering market has increased in the U.S with 40 percent of U.S adults having ordered their food online once.[3] The online food ordering market includes foods prepared by restaurants, prepared by independent people, and groceries being ordered online and then picked up or delivered.<br>

The first online food ordering service, World Wide Waiter (now known as Waiter.com), was founded in 1995. The site originally serviced only northern California, later expanding to several additional cities in the United States.<br>

By the late 2000s, major pizza chains had created their own mobile applications and started doing 20–30 percent of their business online.With increased smartphone penetration, and the growth of both Uber and the sharing economy, food delivery startups started to receive more attention. In 2010, Snapfinger, who is a multi-restaurant ordering website, had a growth in their mobile food orders by 17 percent in one year.<br>

By 2015, online ordering began overtaking phone ordering.<br>

In 2015, China's online food ordering and delivery market grew from 0.15 billion yuan to 44.25 billion yuan.<br>

As of September 2016, online delivery accounted for about 3 percent of the 61 billion U.S. restaurant transactions.<br>

<h6>Service types</h6> <br>

Restaurant-controlled
In restaurant-controlled online food ordering, the restaurants create their own website and app, or choose to hire a delivery vendor. If they choose to create their own website, they make sure to obtain software that manages the orders efficiently, meaning it has the capability to manage different orders at once. When they hire a vendor, the restaurant pays for a monthly fee or percentage-based fees. The vendor covers the developmental costs.<br>

A customer can choose to have the food delivered or for pick-up. The process consists of a customer choosing the restaurant of their choice, scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery. Payment is then administered by paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup. The website and app inform the customer of the food quality, duration of food preparation, and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount of time it will take for delivery. Papa John's is one of the restaurants that created their own Papa John's system, website, and app, and do their own delivery.In 2010, they redesigned their website and launched mobile apps for iPhones, iPads, iPods, Androids Phones, Blackberrys, and Windows Phones.<br>

The preexisting delivery infrastructure of these franchises paired with the online ordering system. In 2010, Papa John's International announced that its online sales had exceeded $2 billion.<br>

In this case, a person cooks and offers meals or kits via their website, which are then directly sent to consumers. The consumer chooses which meal and how many meals they want sent to their office or home, and pays depending on the meals or the program they are interested in. People choose to order meals from other people for different reasons: not wanting or having time to cook, wanting to eat home-cooked meals, or to lose weight by eating healthy foods. Examples of this type of service include DineWise, NutriSystem, Chef's Diet, etc.<br>

<h6>Food cooperatives</h6>
Some food cooperatives like Macomb Co-op allow members to place orders of locally grown and/or produced food online and pick up and pay for their orders at a central location.<br>

<h6>Food riders and drivers</h6>
The riders and drivers for nearly all independent restaurant delivery app services are independent contractors, having the flexibility to choose when they work.[17]. In Australia, specifically riders for the food app of Foodora, consider themselves employees because they sometimes work full time hours, are required to wear uniforms, and do set shifts.<br>

However, food delivery riders and drivers usually do not receive any insurance coverage, protective gear, or sick pay as independent contractors, which have led to some asking for improved safety standards.[19] In response, Deliveroo gave riders a helmet with a GoPro camera to record any problems they may face, specifically with criminals. The riders have the opportunity to raise safety concerns about delivery areas in the app.<br>

<h1>Products and services</h1>
<h2>Online ordering</h2>
Users can place orders online at www.delivery.com or download the mobile app for iOS or Android. To place an order, the user must first enter their address to find out what merchants are available for delivery or pickup. From there, they can add items to their “bag”, including food, alcohol, groceries, or laundry services like wash-and-fold, dry cleaning, or tailoring. Secure payment methods available to delivery.com users include credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Visa Checkout, or cash.[8] They also have the option to leave a tip at the time of checkout.<br>

As a marketplace platform, delivery.com does not make or prepare food, nor does it handle laundry or deliver any of the items sold. When a user places an order, the order details are automatically sent to the intended merchant; the merchant confirms receipt from delivery.com then prepares and delivers the order.<br>

<h2>API Partners</h2>
Delivery.com offers an open Developer API that enables developers to tap into its merchant.[9] As a result of these efforts, delivery.com currently powers online ordering for a number of companies and third-party apps, including WeWork, LevelUp, BringMeThat.com, Menuless.com Zipongo, Foodme.io, and others.<br>

On February 11, 2016, delivery.com announced an integration with Foursquare, powering online ordering for the local discovery app.[13]
